1
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:12,541
- What?
- Hi, Mrs. Reynolds.

2
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:16,548
- What do you want?
- Frank sent me over to pick up his toupee.

3
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,607
- His toupee?
- Yep.

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,984
- What does he need his toupee for?
- I think he has a date.

5
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,324
Frank has a date?

6
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,326
Yeah, I guess.

7
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,328
Well, he can't have it. It's mine.

8
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,263
You own his hair?

9
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,233
All right, fine. It's in a box in the hallway.

10
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,235
I was gonna throw it away anyway.

11
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:40,966
So I'm really sorry about this.
I know it's probably a tough time for you.

12
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,636
Divorce is a tricky thing.
Oh! I found it.

13
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,736
I got the hair now.

14
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:50,579
Found the hair.
So I guess I'll just, uh, see myself out.

15
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,009
Right. Thank you for the hair.

16
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:04,095
Oh, shit.

<i>Wait till you see the hair.</i>

19
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,196
This is really authentic-looking hair.
It looks good.

20
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,634
<i>- So how do you know this chick, anyway?
- Angie Spinola...</i>

21
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,968
High school. Firecracker.
Hung out all the time.

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,905
<i>- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah. We did everything together.</i>

23
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,966
Wild sex. Whoa!

24
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,535
I mean... You name it, we did it.

25
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,946
- Well, she sounds awesome.
- Yeah. They don't make women like Angie anymore.

26
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:58,950
Tell you that right now.

27
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,646
Charlie, you gonna be okay,
I leave you alone at the bar here?

28
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,747
I think things have been going pretty
well since you put me in charge, Frank.

29
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:08,260
Right. Keep your fingers crossed.

30
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,822
What are you?

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,392
Why? Why would a person
wipe their own shit onto a wall?

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,597
<i>I don't know.</i>

33
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,232
What are you doing?
I thought you were cleaning the toilet.

34
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,276
What? Cleaning toilet?
No, that's what Charlie does.

35
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,278
I'm not doing Charlie work anymore.

36
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:29,645
Okay, Dad said we need to,
so get back in there and clean the stall.

37
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,946
Dee, Dee... Will you take it easy?

38
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,282
I got a little plan
to get us out of it.

39
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,288
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

40
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,290
Oh, God, that's good news. What is it?

41
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,485
Well, let's just say
I got a little date tonight...

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,790
and as soon as Charlie sees who it is...

43
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,787
no more Charlie work for me.

44
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,856
How does that help me?

45
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:52,970
- I guess it doesn't, really.
- Mm-mmm. It sure doesn't.

46
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,633
You know, you should
come up with a plan just like I did...

47
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,699
and then you can get out
of Charlie work too.

48
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,473
<i>Oh, you think I can't come up with a plan?</i>

49
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,710
<i>Hey!</i>

50
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:06,775
- Dennis, hey.
- Got something for you.

51
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,912
What? Really?

52
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,548
- Yeah.
- Wow! Oh, thank you.

53
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,615
- That's really nice.
- Can I take your coat?

54
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,718
Uh, are we staying here?

55
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,525
No, no. I just want to have a look
at what you're wearing.

56
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:22,090
- Okay.
- All right.

57
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,728
So... what do you think?

58
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,171
Yeah, okay. That'll work.
Are you not wearing makeup?

59
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,733
- I'm wearing makeup.
- Really?

60
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,302
- Yeah.
- Do you have any more?

61
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,541
No. I didn't bring makeup.

62
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:38,550
Mmm.

63
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:41,109
Uh, okay. That's all right.

64
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,212
Let's go say good night to Charlie. Come on.

65
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,520
Uh, I don't think
that's such a good idea.

66
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,720
Oh, no, no, no. He's totally fine
with the situation.

67
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,729
- It's cool. Come on.
- Really?

68
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,391
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

69
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,893
Hey, buddy.

70
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,496
Please knock if you're
gonna be coming into my off...

71
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,438
What ya doin'?

72
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,506
<i>- Uh, I was doing some office stuff.
- Oh, yeah?</i>

73
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,547
Well, listen, uh,
we are gonna hit the town...

74
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,913
so we just wanted to pop back
and say good night.

75
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,111
Looks like you got everything
under control back here.

76
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:16,622
- Yeah, I do.
- That's a nice house of cards, Charlie.

77
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:19,453
Actually, no. I was doing some business
stuff'cause I'm the manager now.

78
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:22,085
Great. Well, we're out of here.
Don't work too hard, okay, bud?

79
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,561
- Good night, Charlie.
- Yeah, good night.

80
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,065
<i>- Could you, uh, give me one second?
- Yeah.</i>

81
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:29,101
Thanks.

82
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:34,029
Okay, listen. Here's the deal.

83
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,975
I'm gonna bang her tonight,
probably around 10:30 or so.

84
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,978
Now, I really don't wanna do that...

85
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,277
so all you have to do to stop me
is call my cell phone... by 10:30...

86
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,647
and say, "Dennis, you don't
have to do Charlie work anymore."

87
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,585
- You're not gonna get away with this.
- Oh, yeah, I will.

88
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:51,146
I'll get away with it. 10:30, okay?

89
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,093
10:30.

90
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,289
Gonna blackmail me?

91
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,096
You gonna blackmail me,
Dennis Reynolds?

92
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,899
- You ready?
- I'm ready. Let's roll.

93
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,101
- Hey-o! What's up, buddy?
- Hello.

94
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,612
- What's that?
- It's your dad's hair.

95
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,342
- Gross.
- Yeah. Is Charlie here?

96
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,850
Yeah, man. What's up with you?
You seem flustered.

97
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,183
- Is Charlie...
- He's in the back office.

98
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:26,021
- I wanna talk to him.
- Okay. Go talk to him.

99
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,822
- Okay.
- Great. Yeah.

100
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,626
Uh... Bye, Dennis.

101
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,829
See ya.

102
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,372
Charlie, I have a real dilemma on my hands.

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,409
Normally I would never talk to you about
these things because you're so unreliable...

104
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,604
but Dennis, Dee and Frank are all directly
involved, and I gotta tell somebody, man.

105
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,613
I am bustin'. Okay...

106
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,878
Dennis's mom tried
to have sex with me.

107
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,751
- Interesting.
- Yeah, man, she got naked, she came on to me...

108
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:59,485
That woman is straight crazy, but I think
I wanna bang her. I know I shouldn't do it...

109
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,187
- I think you should do it.
- What?

110
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:04,388
An opportunity like this only comes around
once in a lifetime, right?

111
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,955
- Right.
- You'd be a fool to let it slip through your fingers.

112
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,002
Yeah, that's what I'm thinkin',
but it's Dennis and Dee's mom.

113
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:12,503
Well, that means that no one ever,
ever is gonna find out.

114
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,506
- That doesn't make sense.
- It doesn't have to make sense.

115
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:18,237
You're right. I'm gonna do it.

116
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,371
<i>- Okay. Okay. Oh, this is good.
- This is good.</i>

117
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,677
- Oh, this is good.
- Oh, oh, oh... I gotta meet Frank.

118
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,981
- I gotta give him his hair.
- You go, 'cause I gotta plot, and I gotta think.

119
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,385
<i>- Oh, great.
- Get out of here. Go. God, this is good!</i>

120
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:33,050
- Dennis's mom. Yes, he is. I'm busy.
- I want my job back.

121
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,594
- Look, I'm... What?
- I want my job back.

122
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,595
Well, I'm...

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,798
And you shall have it.

124
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,864
Oh, Dee. It looks like we both
need things from each other.

125
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,104
I am not having sex
with you, Charlie.

126
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:54,112
No.

127
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,910
It's not sex I want from you.

128
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,214
It's sex I don't want from Dennis.

129
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,550
Hmm?

130
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,556
Mmm. So you gotta tell me about
all the shit you been gettin' into.

131
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,118
You must have a police record a mile long.

132
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,096
Oh, God. No.

133
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,998
Don't be modest now. You remember
all the shit we used to get into?

134
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,001
- Mm-hmm.
- You remember that night in the graveyard?

135
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,596
- How could I forget?
- That slab was cold, baby.

136
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,607
It was.

137
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,576
And remember the time we robbed
a motorcycle and ran it into the river?

138
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,604
- Yes.
- Well, you must be doin' shit like that now, huh? Come on.

139
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,981
Well, I've slowed down quite a bit
once I met my husband, Carl.

140
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,278
Oh, you told me you weren't married.

141
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,153
Oh, I'm not. Carl passed a few years ago.

142
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:43,252
- Oh.
- Once I met him and had kids, I pretty much stayed at home.

143
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,264
Carl had two children
from a previous marriage...

144
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:49,267
and then we had five of our own.

145
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,462
Oh, shit.

146
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,165
Hi. I'm Jenny.
I'll be your server this evening.

147
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,505
<i>Are you ready to order,
or do you need some more time?</i>

148
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,842
- I think we need just a little more time.
- I'll be back in a second.

149
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,451
<i>Isn't having children a blessing?</i>

150
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,452
What?

151
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,647
Isn't having children
such a blessing?

152
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,622
What the hell are you talking about?

153
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:15,354
Well, I mean, when Carl passed, my children
were an enormous source of strength.

154
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,328
<i>- I mean, I thought...
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.</i>

155
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,330
Angie, I'm gonna have to stop you.

156
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,332
<i>- I'm sorry?
- This is not gonna work out.</i>

157
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,200
- What's not going to work out?
- You, me, talking like this.

158
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:29,401
- Why? What's wrong?
- For starters, you've got kids and shit.

159
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,466
And you talk about 'em.

160
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,240
You talk about your kids,
you talk about your dead husband.

161
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:37,373
- I mean, it's kind of bummin' me out.
- Oh, you know, I'm sorry.

162
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,476
It's not your fault. It's just, maybe...
I think you're too old for me.

163
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:43,283
Frank, I'm two years
younger than you.

164
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,122
That's what I'm talkin' about.

165
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,127
I had a really good time tonight.

166
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,129
I had a good time too.

167
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,427
Okay, what's the deal with that?

168
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,366
- What?
- Why do you keep checking your cell phone?

169
00:08:56,435 --> 00:09:00,064
I've just been... I've been expecting
an important phone call.

170
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,733
- I'm sorry.
- No. Good luck with that.

171
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,174
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't... Don't go. I wanna go inside.

172
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:09,874
- No. I'm not gonna ask you inside, Dennis.
- Why not?

173
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,851
Because I really... like you.

174
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,980
Well, yeah. I mean...

175
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,422
I really like you too.

176
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,655
- Then let's just take it slow, okay?
- Oh-Oh, wait.

177
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:27,899
Uh...

178
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:30,697
I... love you.

179
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:35,297
L...

180
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,365
I kind of don't know what to say.

181
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,536
I kind of don't want you
to say anything.

182
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,251
Oh, uh, hold that thought.

183
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,083
- Yo.
- I'm ready to talk.

184
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,716
Cuttin' it pretty close there, pal.
I almost sealed the deal.

185
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,420
Just meet me at Paddy's
and we'll work it all out.

186
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,635
Sorry about, uh...

187
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,728
I feel like maybe I was being
a little judgmental.

188
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,070
- You're good.
- Okay. Well, let's go.

189
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,304
No. You were right.
I should... I'm gonna go.

190
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,810
Yeah. I'm gonna go now.
We should take it slow.

191
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,611
- You were right.
- Really? Because I...

192
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:20,743
don't need to now.

193
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,380
I think it's good.
I think it's real good.

194
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,890
Call me.

195
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,622
Charlie?

196
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,565
You called just
in the nick of time, buddy. I was...

197
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,963
Looks like we got a blown fuse in here.

198
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,507
Better get on that.
Blown fuses count as Charlie work.

199
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:47,342
<i>Oh, I don't think I'll be
changing any fuses any time soon.</i>

200
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,514
I know something you don't know.

201
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:08,099
That was, like, the best
sex I've ever had, Mrs. Reynolds.

202
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,227
- Like something magical happened.
- Hmm?

203
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,466
I was just saying that
that was, like, so special...

204
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,974
and, I mean, it was like magic.

205
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:20,910
You're not gonna start talking
about your feelings and shit, are you?

206
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:26,109
No.
Gay.

207
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,416
No. It's just that...
I mean, unless you want to, 'cause...

208
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,422
<i>No.</i>

209
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,481
I got a better plan.

210
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,960
Okay. All right. Uh, so can I
call you sometime?

211
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,429
- I have your number, right?
- No, I don't think so.

212
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,898
I know how to find you.
Why don't we leave it at that?

213
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,697
Wh... All right. Did I do something wrong?

214
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,704
I mean, was the sex bad?

215
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:50,230
- Don't worry about it.
- I can make adjustments...

216
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,937
'Cause I've had to do that before,
and it hasn't been a problem.

217
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:56,037
- I'm shutting the door now.
- Well, if I could just have a kiss good-bye...

218
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:58,344
that would be... really great for me.

219
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:02,285
If I gave you a kiss good-bye,
would you let go of the door?

220
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,845
- Yeah.
- Fine.

221
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,521
Oh, my God. Oh!

222
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:15,465
Yeah. It's a terrible thing.
It's a terrible thing for you to see that.

223
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,525
- I'm gonna kill him.
- No...

224
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,197
- I'm gonna kill him!
- No. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

225
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,706
What are you gonna do, punch him
in the face? Throw him?

226
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:25,800
Work the body a little?
No, no, it's not gonna help. I'll tell you why.

227
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,108
It doesn't "un-bang" your mom.

228
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,273
No, you gotta do something worse...

229
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,374
Something much, much worse.

230
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:36,580
You're gonna have to bang Mac's mom.

231
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,826
I thought I was.

232
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:45,125
- Hi.
- What?

233
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:48,633
- I'm looking for Mrs. Mac. Is she in?
- Yeah.

234
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,691
I'm a friend of her son's.

235
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,795
- I know you, Dennis.
- Oh.

236
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,807
Oh, my God.

237
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:01,971
It's been a long time. Haven't seen you
in a while. You look different.

238
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:05,107
<i>- I gained a little weight.
- Is that what it is?</i>

239
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:08,084
<i>- Looks good on you.
- Yeah.</i>

240
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:11,589
Yeah. Do you mind if I sit?

241
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:20,427
So. Watching a little TV outside, huh?

242
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,831
I like the fresh air.

243
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,199
Probably gets a little lonely though
every once in a while...

244
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,261
watching TV out here by yourself.

245
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,241
Every once in a while
you probably want a man, right?

246
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,439
Someone to fulfill your desires.

247
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,776
Oh.

248
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,615
Not interested.

249
00:13:42,688 --> 00:13:45,452
Don't fight it, Mrs. Mac.

250
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,960
Why don't we go inside
and have a little fun?

251
00:13:49,027 --> 00:13:51,621
Don't find you attractive.

252
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,631
What?

253
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,190
I think you're an ugly man.

254
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,461
You think I'm ugly?

255
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,906
- Yeah.
- I'm not ugly. You're ugly.

256
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,001
Yeah.

257
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:10,081
Jesus Christ. What is wrong with you, woman?

258
00:14:10,148 --> 00:14:12,810
You're saying that I'm un...
You don't find me attractive?

259
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:16,047
- No.
- And you're... What? Not gonna have sex with me?

260
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:19,522
<i>- No.
- This is ridiculous. I'm... I'm out of here.</i>

261
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:24,823
Wait. What... What just happened?

262
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:27,023
I think you know exactly
what just happened.

263
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,361
- No.
- Yeah.

264
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,095
No, come on. He did not try
to have sex with that woman.

265
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,228
Oh, he did, 'cause
he's a dirty, dirty pervert.

266
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,502
- I'm... I'm so confused right now.
- Really?

267
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,772
- Are you? I can help you. Don't trust him.
- But...

268
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,109
<i>Uh-oh. Excuse me.</i>

269
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,273
- I need to get this.
- Okay.

270
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,340
Can you pop out real quick?

271
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,352
<i>Really?</i>

272
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,116
Yeah. It's personal.
You don't want to be rude, so...

273
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:53,157
Excuse me.

274
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,887
- Oh, my God.
- Thanks.

275
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:00,025
- Yeah.
- How we doin'?

276
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:02,032
- Cat's in the cradle.
- Good, good, good.

277
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,126
- Time to move to phase two.
- There is no phase two.

278
00:15:05,203 --> 00:15:07,763
I'm not doing phase two.
I did everything you said. It's over.

279
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,706
This isn't over until I say it's over!

280
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,801
God. Sorry. Okay.

281
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,780
Relax, dude. One more phase. That's it.

282
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:19,783
<i>This is Barbara. Leave a message.</i>

283
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,547
Hey, uh... Not answering my calls.

284
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,555
I get it. You're busy. You're busy.

285
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:26,750
It's a busy time of the week.

286
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,488
Um, listen, I think you should give me a call
back because I know what you're afraid of.

287
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,690
You think Frank and Dennis
are gonna find out, but they're not, okay?

288
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,699
I'm gonna keep my mouth
shut on this one.

289
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:38,201
And I know that you know
that the sex was good, right?

290
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,238
<i>So I think maybe we should...</i>

291
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:42,535
There's somebody
at the door. I'm just gonna ignore it.

292
00:15:42,607 --> 00:15:44,734
<i>I think that maybe we should get together...</i>

293
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,438
Oh, they sound pissed. All right, listen.
I'll give you a call back.

294
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:49,446
All right.

295
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,745
- Let's go for a ride.
- Why?

296
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,312
Grab your coat.
We're goin' for a ride.

297
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,188
- Are you going to kill me?
- What?

298
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,524
No. I just wanna go out
and pick up some younger chicks...

299
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,030
and I need a wing man for that.
Come on. Let's roll.

300
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,330
<i>- How about the two
out there on the dance floor?</i>

301
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,632
- Go on. Go on, break the ice.
- Oh, come on, man.

302
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:14,797
- Come on, man. Go. Go.
- All right, all right.

303
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:18,975
Hey, how ya doin'? I like your top.
Lookin' good. Mac.

304
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,774
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Frank.

305
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,782
Wanna get down? Huh?

306
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,380
What happened? What did you do?

307
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:34,516
What are you talking about, what did I do?
What was with that little move?

308
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,720
That move always works
with the ladies.

309
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:38,888
Frank, you have never gotten
a chick with that move.

310
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:42,957
- What are you talkin' about? That's how I got my wife.
- Really?

311
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:45,127
Yeah. So don't go blamin' the move.
The move works.

312
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,531
So, uh, what other kind
of things worked on your wife?

313
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:53,635
- She likes money.
- So she likes money and dancing.

314
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,044
Can we stop talking
about my wife for a second here?

315
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:58,981
You're killin' the vibe.
Let me see now.

316
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:01,883
<i>Over there. Try the move.</i>

317
00:17:01,953 --> 00:17:04,922
You hang over here,
this side, while I...

318
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,524
Hello, hello, hello.

319
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:11,562
I'm Frank. Remember?

320
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,438
Where'd he go? Mac!

321
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,776
<i>Go away.</i>

322
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:35,342
- We need to talk.
- Dee, now's not a good time.

323
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,389
Charlie is making me have sex
with him to get out of Charlie work.

324
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:41,789
- What?
- Yeah, I know. Really gross.

325
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,125
Am I the only one around here
who's not getting laid?

326
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:49,463
Dennis, Charlie is forcing me
to have sex with him.

327
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,525
Mac's getting laid.
You're getting laid.

328
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:54,003
Now even Charlie's getting laid?
This makes me look terrible.

329
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:56,563
Well, you know what?
This is all Charlie's fault.

330
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:59,269
None of this would be happening
if Dad didn't put him in charge.

331
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,608
You're right.

332
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,583
<i>- I'm gonna kill him.
- No, no. Whoa.</i>

333
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,984
You ought to do something worse
than that... Something much, much worse.

334
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:20,230
- Oh! Hello, Dennis.
- Hello, Mrs. Kelly.

335
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:23,563
<i>- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.</i>

336
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,399
Oh. Oh, my!

337
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:29,565
Well, uh, it's good
to see you, Dennis.

338
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,575
What brings you by?

339
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,907
I wanted to bring you
some chocolates.

340
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,312
- Thank you.
- Do you mind if I come in?

341
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,316
Okay.

342
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,183
Oh, no.

343
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,416
That son of a bitch.

344
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,426
- I know it.
- No! No, he said he loved me.

345
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:52,088
How dare he do that?

346
00:18:52,163 --> 00:18:54,154
- I'm gonna stab him.
- Oh.

347
00:18:54,232 --> 00:18:56,564
- I'm gonna stab his face off.
- No. No, stabbing's bad.

348
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,762
You need to do something worse...

349
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,897
Something much, much worse.

350
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:03,998
You gotta sleep with Charlie.

351
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:11,177
Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

352
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:13,376
I'm sorry, sweetie.

353
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:15,817
I just don't find you
sexually attractive.

354
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,856
Are you kidding me?
You don't find me sexually attractive?

355
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:23,086
What in the hell is going on?
What is wrong with you people?

356
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,595
I am sexually a...

357
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,360
I am sexually attractive.
I am an attractive... man.

358
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,673
- Bam.
- What the hell is that?

359
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:42,076
- $443.
- Listen, Mac, let's just end this right now.

360
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,911
I only slept with you
to piss Frank off.

361
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,247
Afterward I felt like
I was gonna throw up.

362
00:19:48,753 --> 00:19:50,744
So Frank makes you want to throw up?

363
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,188
No. You're not listening.

364
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,385
It's you that makes me
want to throw up.

365
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,561
Oh. So you don't want
to be my girlfriend anymore?

366
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,100
- Jesus Christ.
- Wait a second. Hold on.

367
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:06,467
Wait! I'm confused. So you don't
want to be my girlfriend anymore?

368
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,615
- Hey.
- Oh, shit!

369
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,555
No, Mac, it's okay. It's all right.

370
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,684
- Listen, uh...
- Okay, let me explain.

371
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,457
- Just let me explain.
- No, no. I understand, okay?

372
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,489
- You do?
- Yeah. Look, I... I think I know how you're feeling.

373
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,129
Oh, man. That is such a relief.

374
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:42,400
Check this out. L...

375
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:53,082
- You've done well.
- Thank you...

376
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:55,176
And your date with the waitress is all set up.

377
00:20:55,253 --> 00:20:58,518
- Oh! Mmm! That is so wonderful.
- I have to ask you though...

378
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,354
How did you know that your mom
wasn't gonna sleep with Dennis?

379
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,295
Hmm.

380
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:08,958
Guess I kind of overlooked that detail.
Okay, time for phase three, Dee.

381
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:11,263
No, Charlie. You said
there were only two phases.

382
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,497
This one's easy.

383
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:15,902
- Okay. Phase three complete.
- It looks good?

384
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:17,965
- You look really good.
- You sure?

385
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:19,236
- Yes.
- You're all done?

386
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,299
I'm all done. You look great.

387
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,312
- Thanks for helping me out.
- You're welcome.

388
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,314
The waitress is gonna be here soon.

389
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:27,374
I'm gonna go back to bartending,
and you will go back to handling poo-poo.

390
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,613
- Yeah, okay. Phase four...
- No! No.

391
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:31,621
- I got a quick phase four.
- Charlie...

392
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:33,714
- Let me squeak a phase four in.
- I won't... You can't...

393
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,317
- There's no squeaking of phase... No. No.
- Okay, fine!

394
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:38,624
- It's over. Okay?
- Thank you.

395
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:41,859
You are hereby released
of all Charlie work.

396
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:47,801
Hey, guys, uh, can you do me a favor
and not get too drunk?

397
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:50,568
All right? 'Cause I got
some kegs that I need changing.

398
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,576
Uh, there's, like... You know what?

399
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:54,874
- There's some rats down in the rattraps.
- Yeah.

400
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,880
Hello, gang!

401
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,007
You're lookin' at the new Frank.

402
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:03,042
Ooh!

403
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:06,886
What the hell is she doing here?

404
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,017
"What the hell is she doing here?" Really?

405
00:22:09,093 --> 00:22:11,425
<i>Really. I'll tell you
what I'm doing here.</i>

406
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,431
You wanna know what
I'm doing here, shit-for-brains?

407
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,866
I had sex with your dad.

408
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,427
That's right, I had sex with your father...

409
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:24,566
<i>because, just like you,
I like my sex old and ugly.</i>

410
00:22:24,642 --> 00:22:29,875
And with fake hair on their heads that
falls off when you're having sex with 'em.

411
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,576
It just falls off because that's
what you do, Dennis Reynolds.

412
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,948
You like to have sex
with old people.

413
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:37,010
<i>And you said that you loved me!</i>

414
00:22:37,088 --> 00:22:40,615
<i>You said, "I love you,"and so I thought,
"Okay, I love you too."</i>

415
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,354
<i>How do you show love?
You go and have sex with old people.</i>

416
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:45,794
<i>So that's what I did too!</i>

417
