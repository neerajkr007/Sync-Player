<i>- [Mac] That's not a lot of money.</i>
<i>- No, it isn't.</i>

3
00:00:08,593 --> 00:00:11,790
- And our mortgage is due in two weeks.
- We paid that a week ago.

4
00:00:11,863 --> 00:00:14,593
A week ago was
three weeks late, Mac.

5
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,657
Hey, guys.

6
00:00:16,734 --> 00:00:20,500
I met this guy in acting class. He's really cool,
and he wants to see where I work.

7
00:00:20,571 --> 00:00:23,267
So could you guys
try to not be weird?

8
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:27,710
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I love you guys, but sometimes
you're not that cool.

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:29,804
- We're cool!
- Not cool?

10
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:32,349

- Sometimes <i>you're</i> not too cool.

11

- Charlie...
<i>- Always cool, man.</i>

12

- Oh, hey, man, we're closed.
- Yeah, I know.

13
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:40,515
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want any trouble.
- What?

14
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:43,321
Guys, this is Terrell...

15
00:00:43,394 --> 00:00:45,328
from my acting class.

16
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,200
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, man. How's it goin'?

17
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:54,397

<i>- Good, man.</i>

18
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,497
- We're just chillin', dude.
- Great.

19

Whoa.

21
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:03,873
Guess you guys don't have too many brothers
walking through here.

22
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:05,882
- Oh, no, no.
- We got plenty of brothers.

23
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,747
Yeah...
A-African-Americans.

24
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:09,980
- Okay. Yeah, we get it.
- [Overlapping Chatter]

25
00:01:10,054 --> 00:01:12,522
You might know some of them.

26
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:16,585
Yeah.
We're probably related.

27
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:18,686
No.

28
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:22,096
I don't think he was implying that you guys
are all related. That's ridiculous.

29
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:26,569
<i>Sweet Dee came in here a second ago</i>
<i>and started talking about acting class.</i>

30

- We weren't expecting you to be black, that's all.

31
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:35,778
Right.

Whoa. You had 400 people
packed into a place?

39
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:30,467
You damn right.
That's my job, man.

40
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:32,503
And it's mostly college kids.

41
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,970
My sister goes to Temple,
so I got the hookup over there.

42
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,904
And hookups are good.

43
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:41,035
But, just to be clear, when you say your sister,
do you mean your sister or your friend...

44
00:02:41,112 --> 00:02:42,909
- Dude.
- Oh, Jesus.

45
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,250
- I mean my sister.
<i>- Oh. Okay. Cool.</i>

46
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,412
I was just... Because
he could mean his friend or his...

47
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:52,353
Stop talking.

48
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:54,857
So we're packed into
this little place on Walnut.

49
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:58,020
We're halfway through the night,
everything's goin' all right.

50
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,963
All of a sudden, I notice this dude
eyeballin' me from across the bar.

51
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:06,163
- Shit.
- I don't know if this dude
wants to freak me or fight me.

52
00:03:06,237 --> 00:03:08,967
<i>- He's giving you crazy eyes.</i>
- The insane, crazy eyes.

- Right?
- I know that.

54
00:03:10,975 --> 00:03:13,341
So I walk over...
He's this big, cut Mexican dude...

55
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:17,074
and I look at him and say,
"Yo, <i>ese...</i>

56
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:20,640
unless you want
to get yo' ass torn apart...

57
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:23,243
you'd better get
that look off your face."

58
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:26,381
- [Giggles] No!
- You just walked right up to him and said that?

59
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,857
I had to, man.
You gotta make the first move.

60
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:31,861
- Always make the first move.
You know what I'm sayin'?
- l-I know.

61
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:34,864
- So what happened?
- Well, hey, he won't stop starin' me down.

62
00:03:34,932 --> 00:03:39,028
We're, like, eyeball to eyeball. His grill is
right up in mine. It feels like an eternity.

63
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:41,401
<i>Finally...</i>

64
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,839
he just opens up his mouth
and says...

65
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:49,141
[Mexican Accent] " I guess you gon' have to
tear my ass apart, homes."

66
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:52,478
- [Mouthing Words]
- Oh, man. So what'd you do?

67
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,575
Took him to the back alley...

68
00:03:54,652 --> 00:03:57,280
and I tore his ass apart!

69
00:03:57,355 --> 00:03:59,152
- Oh, my God!
- [All Chattering]

70
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:00,918

00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:07,360
Okay, I would like to do
things like that.

73
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:10,366
I love that guy.
"I took him to the back alley"?

74
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:13,926
- Who does shit like that? It's like a movie.
- There's something off about him.

75
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,873
- Oh, bro, that's racist.
- No, asshole, that's not what I meant.

76
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:20,809
- I'll go get the coffee. What do you guys want?
- Dude, sit down. Okay?

77
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:23,813
Wait till the waitress comes out here,
and then you can stare at her.

78
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:26,975
- I wasn't gonna stare at her. I was just gonna...
- He wasn't gonna stare at her.

79
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:30,111
- You're totally obsessed with that chick.
- No, I'm not. I like her.

80
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:34,624
I have a little bit of a crush, yes.
But obsessed? That's a bit of a harsh word.

81
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:39,186
- It's never gonna happen.
- Honestly, I think we should
think about hiring Terrell.

82
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:41,128
- Why? For what?
- You heard him.

83
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,428
When he's promotin',
everybody named Mama's looking to get in.

84
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,368
That's true. They do have
"niggers hanging from rafters."

85
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:49,372
- Wow. Nice.
- No, that's not what I was saying.

86
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,839
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

87
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,809
- Hitler?
- No, I'm not... I'm not Adolf Hitler.

88
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:56,813
- I'll make sure to put lots of cream in yours.
- I was quoting a black friend.

- Okay.
- [Exhales]

90
00:04:58,883 --> 00:05:00,817
Well, that's just great.

91
00:05:00,885 --> 00:05:03,854
- Now she thinks I'm racist.
- Dude, will you just drop it?

92
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:07,322
Listen, ifTerrell delivers half of what he promises,
we're looking at 200 people.

93
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,953
- Yeah, that's true.
- It'd be nice to get some chicks in the bar.

94
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:14,156
All right, let's do it.

95
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,334
- Sure about this?
- It's 2005, Charlie.

96
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,840
Don't you think it's ridiculous that you have
no friends outside of your own race?

97
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,843
- No, what is ridiculous is this stupid plan.
- It's not stupid!

98
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,505
- It's a stupid plan.
- It's not... This is a college campus.

99
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,016
This is a great place to meet people
of different cultures, diversify...

100
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:35,951
You're just trying to make black...
Mm-hmm.

101
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:38,988
You're trying to make
black friends.

102
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:42,492
- You're not making it easy.
- You're trying to impress Terrell
with a couple of black friends.

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,653
Don't do this right now.

I could get you a game.

Uh, no, I shouldn't.
I'm not very good, so...

This is bullshit.
Absolute bullshit.

- Why do these people like you
more than they like me?
- Maybe it's comments like that.

125
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,459
I meant those people in there, not all black
people. What am I supposed to say?

126
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,431
You should say something different.
Figure something else out.

That girl's gorgeous.

She's the perfect opportunity to prove we're
not racist. She probably has friends for me.

I'll call the black girl. Okay?

160
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,559
Okay, buddy.

161

We're cool. We're cool.

162
00:08:32,296 --> 00:08:35,356
We're good.
Thanks, guys. See ya.

163
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,672
I had the craziest dream last night
that I was in Cleveland, Ohio...

164
00:08:43,741 --> 00:08:46,676
which is really weird,
because I've never even been to Ohio.

165
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:49,679
This guy was wearing a bunny suit,
and he was coming out...

166
00:08:49,747 --> 00:08:52,682
You know what, Dee?
I don't wanna hear about your dreams. Okay?

167
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,686
I hate listening to people's dreams.
It's like flipping through a stack of photographs.

168
00:08:56,754 --> 00:09:00,190
If I'm not in any of'em and nobody's
having sex, I just... I don't care.

169
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:03,124
Oh. I'm sorry.
I would listen to your dreams.

170

- What cute one?

194
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:23,699
Mac, isn't that your cousin Brett
by the jukebox?

195
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:27,440

- What's up, Brett? Can you believe this crowd?

198
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:37,583
- Oh, it's something else!
- Yeah!

199
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:40,283
Gentlemen, I understand
my services have been requested.

200
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:42,723
I actually got a couple of services
I'd like to request.

Whoa! Uh, what are you doin, man?
I'm not...

- Yeah, thanks.

How could you not tell me
you were gay?

213
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:31,006
I'm a musical theater actor living in Philadelphia.
I didn't think it was that big a secret.

214
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:33,270
I've been coming on to you
for weeks now.

215
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:35,972
- Just thought you were into gay dudes.
- I am not into gay dudes!

216

- Apparently you are.
- Okay, well, you know what?

217
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:41,282
The guys hired you to promote their bar,

We should <i>totally</i>

- We're a gay bar from now on.
- Absolutely, man!

- No, it's not nice.

plugging anybody's holes.

- Of course you are.

I made $300 last night.
How much did you make?

234
00:12:21,091 --> 00:12:24,288
First of all, that's rude. And that has
nothing to do with what I'm talking about.

235
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:26,295
It has everything to do with it.

236

I don't think we have much of a choice.
We need to do this.

237
00:12:28,866 --> 00:12:33,235
If you guys remember, one of the major reasons
we got this bar was to get laid.

238
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:36,534
Maybe <i>you</i> did it to get laid. I got a
little something I like to call business ethics.

Oh, bullshit. You don't care about the money.
You just like the attention.

- K-K-Keeping in mind that you don't get a vote.
- Why?

255

- Yeah, sure. No problem.
- All right.

318
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:47,371
- Where are you going?
- I gotta talk to a couple friends
from my acting class.

319
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:50,075
But seriously...
blackout drunk.

320
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:58,757
All right.
Okay.

321
00:16:58,825 --> 00:17:02,693
So you did the lime first,
and then the shot, right?

322
00:17:02,763 --> 00:17:05,323
No. No, no, no, no.
Dude.

323
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,833
- You take the salt...
- Take the salt.

324
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,835
and then you take the shot.

325
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,837
- Okay.
- [Spits]

326
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,965
- And then you suck on the lime. Okay?
- Okay.

327
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:19,069
Why don't you show me again.
'Cause I'm getting a little bit confused.

328
00:17:19,146 --> 00:17:22,013
- You lick it.
- Salt. Lick it.

329
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,073
- And then you slam it.
- Yeah?

330
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,556
[Hiccups]

331
00:17:31,992 --> 00:17:33,892
Oh, that's great.

332
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:36,429
All right, so,
I'm gonna do the shot first...

333
00:17:36,496 --> 00:17:40,694
No, no, no, no... Oh... Oh, please, please, dude.
You're not listening to me.

334
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,701
Well, I'm just not getting it, bro.

335
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,703
- You do the salt first.
- The salt first.

336
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:47,706
- And then the lime.
- Show me again, because I'm not...

337
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:50,504
The salt first.
<i>Then</i> the lime.

338

Oh, God.
[Groans]

343
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:16,535
Hello.

344
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,594
Mmm.

345
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:24,109
[Sighs]
Nice.

346
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:27,606
[Sighs]
Beautiful.

[Both Moaning]

348
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,920
- Hello, lover.
- [Screams]

349
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,922
Whoa!

350
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,720
What the hell!
What is going on here?

351
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:43,126
Relax, stud. You got nothing
to be ashamed about.

352
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:45,164
What the f...
What does that mean?

353
00:18:45,232 --> 00:18:46,790
- Did we have...
<i>- No. No.</i>

354
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:50,064
Don't be silly.
It was all hands.

355
00:18:50,137 --> 00:18:52,867
How's that ass feelin'?

356
00:18:54,908 --> 00:18:58,173
<i>[Charlie] I'm really glad</i>
<i>you decided to embrace this.</i>

357
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:01,180
- You're doing the right thing, bro.
- I think so too, dude.

358
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:04,115
- I feel really good
about broadening my horizons.
- It's gonna be fun.

359
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,209
- It's a good business decision.
- Yeah!

360
00:19:06,286 --> 00:19:10,188
I don't want to own
a gay bar anymore.

361
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:12,885
What, dude?
Oh, no. What happened?

362
00:19:12,959 --> 00:19:15,894
<i>Just, uh... I was doing</i>
<i>some thinking and, you know...</i>

363
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:19,420
We had our little experiment. It was great.
But we should go back to normal.

364
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:23,026
Oh. You had an experiment, and you want to
go back to the way it was before the experiment.

365
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:25,037
- Interesting.
- The <i>bar.</i>

366
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:28,768
We had our experiment with the bar,
and it was great. Let's go back to normal.

367
00:19:28,842 --> 00:19:31,777
You're done experimenting?
Or are you gonna experiment some more?

368
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:34,405
- What is this experimenting?
- Hey, Dennis! What's up?

369
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:36,415
Listen, I got you some new CDs.

370
00:19:36,483 --> 00:19:40,078
'Cause the music you had in the jukebox
was a little bit stale.

371
00:19:40,153 --> 00:19:42,417
Also, we gotta get rid
of these shamrocks.

372
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:45,424
'Cause nothing scares gays and black folks
like Irish crap.

373
00:19:45,492 --> 00:19:48,655
- Can we talk for a second in private?
- Yeah. No problem.

374
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,597
So, listen, Terrell,
it's not really working out.

375
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:55,191
- We're gonna have to let you go.
- I thought you were happy.

376
00:19:55,268 --> 00:20:00,001
No, we <i>were</i> happy. But then Dennis had an
experiment, and he wants to go back to normal.

377
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,770
Yeah, we had that experiment...
Why do you keep saying it like that?

378
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:05,744
You guys are being ridiculous.

379
00:20:05,812 --> 00:20:08,679
Yeah, we're being ridiculous!
We're making a lot of money!

380
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,309
- Yes! Thank you!
- Look, everybody! Sweet Dee's here!

381
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:14,319
- Hey, everybody!
- Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing here?

382
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:17,982
- Charlie?
- What is going on here?
You guys know each other?

383
00:20:18,058 --> 00:20:20,390
Yeah! That's the crazy bitch
that punched me in my eye!

384
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,792
Charlie!
That's my sister.

385
00:20:24,998 --> 00:20:27,728
Now, just to clarify,
when you say "sister," you mean...

386
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:30,201
I mean my sister.

387
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,261
Yes! Okay!
This is great!

388
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:35,968
Because earlier
you were implying that I was racist...

389
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:39,068
<i>because you thought that I was implying</i>
<i>that all black people are related.</i>

390
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,637
And then it turns out
that you people actually are!

391
00:20:46,253 --> 00:20:50,246
No, that's not what I meant. Hold on a second.
I meant that <i>you two</i> actually are.

392
00:20:50,323 --> 00:20:53,656
Mac? Stop talkin'.

393
00:20:58,498 --> 00:21:01,661
Hundred and 11, hundred and 12,
hundred and 13...

394
00:21:01,735 --> 00:21:03,669
$114!

395
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:05,671
- On a Saturday night!
- We're back to normal.

396
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:07,673
We are back to normal.

397
00:21:07,741 --> 00:21:09,675
Mmm.

398
00:21:09,743 --> 00:21:11,677
Dee, I gotta know.

399
00:21:11,745 --> 00:21:15,681
What, exactly, did you tell those guys
from your acting class to do to Dennis?

400
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:18,843
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
That didn't work out.

401
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:22,184
- What?
- Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of those guys.

402
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:26,289
Then why was he so freaked out?

403
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,520
How's that ass feelin'?
